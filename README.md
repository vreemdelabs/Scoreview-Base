# Scoreview-Base
Scoreview is a tool to analyse music and learn how to play it on various instruments.

Command to build it:

make project


It needs a lot of dependecies: SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_image, Portaudio, Tinyxml, libevent, SDL2_net, libsndfile, OpenGL, glm, OpenCL, Protocol buffers, FLTK, DSPFilters.
And yes it uses SDL2_net and libevent, because SDL2_net was somehow easier to compile for the Android tests with the practice window.

The artwork in the app directory is not available on github and must be recovered from the sourcecode tar file @ www.vreemdelabs.com
